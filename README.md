# Blocky Website Builder
Just a website builder I've been working on for a couple of hours....

## You will need to add an .env file with these statements
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Dependencies
